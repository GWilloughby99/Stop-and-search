# Stop-and-search

This repository contains the r markdowns and graphics used in my stop and search article.

The article can be read [here](https://gwilloughby99.github.io/2020-01-03-stopandsearch-analysis/)

# Analysis and editorial choices

All statements from the police forces were included in the piece. The article, alongside my data analysis, highlight that Bedfordshire Police Force were, in fact, fair with their use of stop and search. The disproportionately claims were answered and were rightly outlined. 

As for West Midlands and West Yorkshire, there are still some concerns with high crime areas seemingly the only explanation as to why Asian people were a lot more likely to be stopped compared to white people.

The markdowns are publically accessible, as well as the data which can be [found here](https://data.police.uk/data/).

I strive to be fair and balanced as a journalist. This involves allowing others to view the data and see my methods. 

The article achieves balance by allowing the respective forces a chance to justify, whilst at the same time, not make any assumptions about whether disproportionately exists acorss any other force.

Further analysis is required to make national claims.
